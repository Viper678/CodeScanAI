# CodeScan

> **TODO:** rename project. Placeholder: **CodeScan**.

CodeScan is a web app that lets a developer upload a codebase (zip or loose files), select the files they care about, and run one or more LLM-powered scans against them: **security**, **bug report**, and **keyword** scans. Results are normalized, filterable, and exportable.

The model used for analysis is **Gemma 4 31B** (Google AI Studio API, 256K context).

---

## Features (v1)

- Email + password auth (bcrypt + JWT, refresh-rotation)
- Upload a `.zip` or one-or-more individual source files (≤ 100 MB zip / ≤ 50 MB per file)
- Server-side extraction with zip-bomb / path-traversal protection
- Hydrated directory tree in the UI with sane default exclusions and tri-state checkbox selection
- Three orthogonal scan types per run:
  1. **Security scan** (OWASP-style: injections, hardcoded secrets, weak crypto, etc.)
  2. **Bug report scan** (null derefs, off-by-one, race conditions, resource leaks, logic bugs)
  3. **Keyword scan** (user-supplied keywords / phrases — case sensitivity & regex toggle)
- Async scan execution via Celery; per-file progress streamed back over polling (SSE optional later)
- Findings table with severity, file/line, snippet, and remediation hint
- Export findings to JSON / CSV / SARIF (SARIF can ship in v1.1)

## Quick start (local)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill in GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY at minimum
docker compose up --build
```

Then:

- Web → http://localhost:3000
- API → http://localhost:8000 (docs at `/docs`)
- Postgres → `localhost:5432`
- Redis → `localhost:6379`

2. `docs/FLOW.md` — what happens end-to-end
3. `docs/SCHEMA.md` + `docs/API.md` — data and contracts
4. `docs/TASKS.md` — pick a task
5. `docs/WORKFLOW.md` — branch, build, test, PR
6. `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` — code conventions

## Status

🟡 In active development. Phase 4 complete (T4.1–T4.4); pause/resume + permanent delete (T4.5–T4.6) shipped on top, plus a worker dispatch concurrency lock + leak fix (T4.7).

Shipped:

- Auth: register / login / me, refresh-token rotation + family-based stolen-token revocation
- Upload: `.zip` and loose-file ingest, server-side extraction with zip-bomb / path-traversal / nesting-depth guards, materialized file tree
- Scans API: create / get / list / cancel / delete + recent-files tail (`/scans/{id}/files`) + re-run (`POST /scans/{id}/rerun`) + pause / resume (`POST /scans/{id}/pause`, `POST /scans/{id}/resume`); file-ownership validation, `MAX_FILES_PER_SCAN` cap; `GET /scans` honors `?status=` (comma-joined, includes `paused`) and `?upload_id=`. Cancel works from `paused` directly.
- Findings API: cursor-paginated `GET /scans/{id}/findings` with severity / scan_type / file_id filters and `GET /scans/{id}/export?fmt=json|csv` streaming exports
- Worker: Gemma client (`google-genai`) with retry policy + Pydantic validation; scanner orchestrator (`run_scan` Celery task) with bounded thread pool, cancellation, and per-file findings persistence; pause flag observed between files with clean drain (in-flight files complete and persist findings); Postgres advisory lock per `scan_id` fences concurrent dispatches with Celery exponential-backoff retry; orphan-running recovery via `STUCK_THRESHOLD_SECONDS`; `pg_advisory_unlock_all()` on worker startup defends against locks leaked by recycled processes
- Web: auth pages, full new-scan wizard (upload → file selection → scan config → confirm), the live `/scans/{id}` progress page (status-aware polling, determinate progress + ETA, severity counters, recent-files tail, **Pause / Resume / Cancel** controls with state-aware button gating and a "Resuming…" spinner through the brief `paused → pending` window), the post-completion findings table (filter chips synced to URL, expandable rows with snippet + recommendation, JSON/CSV export menu), the read-only file viewer at `/uploads/{upload_id}/files/{file_id}` (lazy-loaded CodeMirror 6 with language autodetect, severity-colored gutter markers, sidebar list, scroll-to-line on link-through from findings), and the `/scans` dashboard with status multi-select chips (URL-driven, `paused` included) plus per-row **Re-run** and **Delete** actions; `/uploads` gets the same row-level **Delete** (with cascade-warning confirmation)
- File-content API: `GET /uploads/{upload_id}/files/{file_id}/content` streams text with size cap + binary guard + path-traversal defense in depth

Next up: Phase 5 hardening — T5.1 Redis-backed rate limiting on auth / uploads / scans.
